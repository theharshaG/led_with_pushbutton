## LED Blink with Push Button (ESP32)

### Description
This project demonstrates how to control an LED using a push button with ESP32.
When the button is pressed, the LED turns ON. When released, the LED turns OFF.

### Components Used
- ESP32 Dev Module
- LED
- Push Button
- Jumper wires (simulated)

### Pin Connections 

LED:Long leg -GPIO 5 and short leg- GND
Button - connect one side of the button to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 4 or 26) and the other side to GND
